Steps to deploy:
1. Create a new GitHub repository named **carlyrodriguez.github.io** (Public).
2. Upload _all_ files and folders from this package to the repository root (you can drag-and-drop in the GitHub web UI).
3. In the repository, go to Settings → Pages.
   - Under "Build and deployment", set Branch to `main` (or the default branch) and folder to `/ (root)`.
   - Save.
4. Wait ~1–2 minutes and visit: https://carlyrodriguez.github.io

Files of interest to edit:
- `_config.yml` — site title, description, social links.
- `index.md`, `about.md`, `research.md`, `cv.md`, `contact.md` — page content (Markdown).
- `assets/img/profile.png` — replace with your photo (square; 600x600 recommended).
- `cv.pdf` — replace this placeholder with your real CV PDF (same filename).

If you prefer editing locally, you can `git clone` the repo, commit changes, and push.
