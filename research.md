## Research

### Background
Neurons face multiple stressors during development and in disease. My work focuses on understanding how intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms support neuronal survival and functional resilience.

### Approach
- Use human stem cellâ€“derived neuronal models to study stress responses.
- Apply imaging, molecular assays, and functional readouts to quantify resilience.
- Investigate glucocorticoid signaling and mitochondrial responses as mediators of neuronal outcomes.

### Recent / Ongoing Projects
- **Project A:** (placeholder) Design description and key aims.
- **Project B:** (placeholder) Short summary of methods and expected impact.

(Replace with specific aims, figures, and publications as desired.)
