## About Me

My name is Carly Rodriguez and I am a Neuroscience PhD Candidate in the Pera Lab and a student through Tufts University's collaborative program at The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) in Bar Harbor, ME. My work uses pluripotent stem cellâ€“based models to investigate cellular and molecular mechanisms that promote neuronal resilience, particularly in the context of stress and age. 

Before coming to JAX, I graduated from Ursinus College in Collegeville, PA with my Bachelor's of Science degree in Neuroscience. At the time I started my undergraduate journey, I was very interested in neurological disease. After working as a nursing aide in a memory care unit for three years, I grew more passionate about neurodegenerative disease and age-related cognitive changes. In this time, I was simultaneously gaining laboratory research experience that fostered my interest in cellular and molecular neurobiology. 

Outside of the lab, I can be found hiking, dancing, reading, or crocheting. I love to be out doors, especially in the beautiful Acadia National Park and have slowly been starting to enjoy running.
